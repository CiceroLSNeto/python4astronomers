Practical Python for Astronomers
===================================

Practical Python for Astronomers is a series of hands-on workshops to explore
the Python language and the powerful analysis tools it provides. *The emphasis
is on using Python to solve real-world problems that astronomers are likely to
encounter in research.*

- The workshops immediately make use of the full suite of plotting,
  analysis, and file reading tools.
- Along the way elements of the Python language such as control structures,
  functions, and objects are introduced.

About the Workshops
-------------------

The content presented here is suitable for self-study by those wishing to learn
Python for astronomy or other scientific research applications.  

**A greater goal is for those knowledgable in Python to teach the workshop
series at their local institutions, adapting the content as desired.**  To that
end we have developed the content in Sphinx RestructuredText and hosted the
source on github at `<https://github.com/python4astronomers/>`_.  Anyone
interested can clone the repository or download a tarball and make
modifications needed to present the material locally.  We would also welcome
suggestions for improvement, particularly as a Github pull request!


Workshop Schedule
-----------------

The workshop schedule is as follows.  Except for the first introductory session all
workshops are hands-on and participants should bring a laptop.
